Resume screening using machine learning involves employing algorithms to automatically analyze and filter resumes. 
These systems can assess qualifications, skills, experience, and other relevant criteria by comparing the content of resumes against job descriptions.
I have performed this project on google colab using deep learning concept.
I have used various graphs such as pie-chart, bar-chart using seaborn library.
